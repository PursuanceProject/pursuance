## 2.0.1 - 2016-02-21

### Changed

- Update `commonmark-react-renderer` dependency to latest version to add keys to all elements and simplify custom renderers.

## 2.0.0 - 2016-02-21

### Changed

- **Breaking change**: The renderer now requires Node 0.14 or higher. This is because the renderer uses stateless components internally.
- **Breaking change**: `allowNode` now receives different properties in the options argument. See `README.md` for more details.
- **Breaking change**: CommonMark has changed some type names. `Html` is now `HtmlInline`, `Header` is now `Heading` and `HorizontalRule` is now `ThematicBreak`. This affects the `allowedTypes` and `disallowedTypes` options.
- **Breaking change**: A bug in the `allowedTypes`/`disallowedTypes` and `allowNode` options made them only applicable to certain types. In this version, all types are filtered, as expected.
- **Breaking change**: Link URIs are now filtered through an XSS-filter by default, prefixing "dangerous" protocols such as `javascript:` with `x-` (eg: `javascript:alert('foo')` turns into `x-javascript:alert('foo')`). This can be overridden with the `transformLinkUri`-option. Pass `null` to disable the feature or a custom function to replace the built-in behaviour.

### Added

- New `renderers` option allows you to customize which React component should be used for rendering given types. See `README.md` for more details. (Espen Hovlandsdal / Guillaume Plique)
- New `unwrapDisallowed` option allows you to select if the contents of a disallowed node should be "unwrapped" (placed into the disallowed node position). For instance, setting this option to true and disallowing a link would still render the text of the link, instead of the whole link node and all it's children disappearing. (Espen Hovlandsdal)
- New `transformLinkUri` option allows you to transform URIs in links. By default, an XSS-filter is used, but you could also use this for use cases like transforming absolute to relative URLs, or similar. (Espen Hovlandsdal)

## 1.2.4 - 2016-01-28

### Changed

- Rolled back dependencies because of breaking changes

## 1.2.3 - 2016-01-24

### Changed

- Updated dependencies for both `commonmark` and `commonmark-react-parser` to work around an embarrasing oversight on my part.

## 1.2.2 - 2016-01-08

### Changed

- Reverted change from 1.2.1 that uses the dist version. Instead, documentation is added that specified the need for `json-loader` to be enabled when using webpack.

## 1.2.1 - 2015-12-29

### Fixed

- Use pre-built (dist version) of commonmark renderer in order to work around JSON-loader dependency.

## 1.2.0 - 2015-12-16

### Added

- Added new `allowNode`-property. See README for details.

## 1.1.4 - 2015-12-14

### Fixed

- Set correct `libraryTarget` to make UMD builds work as expected

## 1.1.3 - 2015-12-14

### Fixed

- Update babel dependencies and run prepublish only as actual prepublish, not install

## 1.1.1 - 2015-11-28

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with React external name in global environment (`react` vs `React`)

## 1.1.0 - 2015-11-22

### Changed

- Add ability to allow/disallow specific node types (`allowedTypes`/`disallowedTypes`)

## 1.0.5 - 2015-10-22

### Changed
