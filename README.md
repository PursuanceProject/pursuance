## What is Pursuance?

Pursuance is open source software for effectively organizing groups
and individuals to achieve a shared mission.

At its core, **Pursuance is end-to-end encrypted task management software designed to facilitate mass collaboration/coordination**,
and that has a number of unique features.


### The Big Picture

Pursuance enables participants to: create action-oriented groups
called "pursuances", securely discuss how best to achieve their
mission, rapidly record strategies and ideas in an actionable form
(namely as tasks), divvy up those tasks among one other, share files
and documents, get summoned when relevant events occur (e.g., when
they are assigned a task, or when mentioned), request help from
others, receive social recognition for their contributions (via karma
points), and to delegate tasks _to other pursuances_ in this ecosystem
in order to harness its collective intelligence, passion, and
expertise.

Pursuance can be used for a great many things.  But we, its creators,
have certain interests. Specifically, we are focused on organizing
activists, journalists, and non-profits in order to help solve serious
problems we face as a society -- the surveillance state, the police
state, the drug war, and many more.

**Fundamentally, we aim to confront and correct, via an energetic, global network of forward-thinking individuals, the injustices imposed on society by criminalized institutions the world over.**

## Software components: LeapChat and Pursuance

The software that makes up the Pursuance System has 2 major
features/components: **secure chat**, and **task management**.

The task management functionality can be found at
https://github.com/PursuanceProject/pursuance .  This `pursuance` repo
uses LeapChat (currently via an iframe, though this will change);
LeapChat can be found in its own GitHub repo at
https://github.com/cryptag/leapchat .

So, to be clear, we have:

1. [**LeapChat**](https://github.com/cryptag/leapchat) -- end-to-end
encrypted chat in the browser (which we've already launched; see
[LeapChat.org](https://www.leapchat.org/)), and

2. [**Pursuance**](https://github.com/PursuanceProject/pursuance) --
end-to-end encrypted task management optimized for large groups of
volunteers.


### The Interplay Between Chat and Task Management

Each pursuance has many associated tasks. Each task has its own
LeapChat room attached to it for discussing the details of what should
be done, how best to achieve that task, etc.


## Unique Features

Aside from the unique aspects mentioned [on our June-July 2018 Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/85883596/barrett-browns-pursuance-project), here are some features that differentiate
the Pursuance System from other task management-centric software:


#### Task/Participant Auto-pairing and Recruitment by Skill Set

When you have a non-trivial number of people participating in a
pursuance, they're not going to know each other's skill sets, and
therefore won't know who they should assign a task that they think
_someone_ should complete, or that they personally need done as a
sub-task of whatever they are working on.

_Other task management systems do not scale_ in the ways we need them
to.

In Pursuance, when a new task is created and the skills necessary to
complete it are specified (by tag), participants within that task's
pursuance who have all of the requisite skills will be notified and
asked if they'd like to be the assignee.  (Users will add their skills
to their respective profiles so that this pairing can occur.)

We'll also build in skill-based recruitment that lets users request
help from users who are on the same _server_ as the pursuance you're
recruiting from and who have opted into creating a server-wide profile
that includes their skills and interests.


#### Assigning Tasks to Other Pursuances

Other systems think it terms of _teams_.  What is a team?  A small
group of closely-knit people who know each other's names, skill sets,
and so on.  But a team is also a silo cut off from the rest of the
world.

Pursuance does not see the world this way.  By enabling pursuances to
assign tasks _to other pursuances_, we are enabling a federation of
politically-aligned organizations/groups/projects asking each other
for help, perhaps specializing within the ecosystem, and offering
their unique talents and knowledge to other pursuances with whom they
partner.


#### Automatic Task Reassignment

Volunteers are flaky. Someone will often volunteer for a task, or
otherwise have a task assigned to them, and not do it.

When a task's assignee hasn't made recent progress, Pursuance will
either ask the task's creator or reviewer if they want to ask its
assignee for a status update, or Pursuance could automatically,
periodically ask for said updates from assignees _without_ first
asking the reviewer if these messages should be sent out.  But the
interesting part is: an unresponsive or otherwise seemingly
not-working-on-the-task assignee can be given, say, 24 hours (or a
dynamic amount of time depending on the "velocity" of the pursuance,
which we can measure by tracking changes in the task phases) to
respond or to make progress or _do something_, after which, if nothing
is done, **our software can automatically reassign this task** to,
say, the last person who logged in who has all of the skills required
by the task, or to the person with the most karma points with all the
requisite skills, or to the person who invited the current assignee to
the pursuance in the first place, or some other auto-calculable
variant.

...and in writing this, I just realized that the tasks's _reviewer_,
not just assignee, could be auto-reassigned in the same fashion if a
task is finished but the reviewer doesn't mark it as done for some
period of time.


#### End-to-end Encryption

For private pursuances, tasks will be encrypted, in which case the
server will not be able to see the title, description, deliverables,
etc of a task in unencrypted form, just its relation to other tasks,
who it's assigned to, who its reviewer is, and its phase/how close it
is to being completed.

The crypto library we are currently using is
[miniLock](https://github.com/kaepora/minilock), which has undergone a
thorough security audit by the venerable Cure53.  miniLock enables us
to deterministically generate a passphrase from (1) a username or
email address and (2) a passphrase.  From the user's perspective, they
will sign into Pursuance as they would sign into any other website or
app (other than us requiring a stronger password), but in this case we
are generating a keypair for that user, which JavaScript running in
their browser (and, later, their native app) uses to encrypt and
decrypt content.

Each private pursuance is associated with 3 top-level passphrases,
each of which used to generate a unique keypair using miniLock.  That
passphrase is generated in the browser/on the device of the user who
created that pursuance.  When some other user is invited to a private
pursuance, the invite includes a passphrase that can be used to
decrypt an encrypted copy of the top-level-key-generating passphrase
(using the same technique as
[miniShare](https://github.com/cryptag/minishare), which we also
built, and that has been launched at <https://minishare.io>), depending
upon which
[permissions level](https://github.com/PursuanceProject/ensue/wiki/Permissions#fine-grained-permissions)
they were invited at.


## Tech Stack

Pursuance is all React on the frontend and Go + Postgres +
[PostgREST](https://tryingtobeawesome.com/postgrest/) on the
backend. (Adding TypeScript to the React code would be nice to do at
some point, though I'm not sure when.)

The strategy: write React code once, begin on-boarding users into a
web app version of Pursuance by June 2018, make a bunch of
improvements based on user feedback, add [various features](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/85883596/barrett-browns-pursuance-project),
then reuse 80% of that code to build a React Native version for
Android and iOS, and also a native desktop version using Electron. And
then we'll have a 3rd party security audit done.

# Running Pursuance

## WARNING

Do not expose the server in this branch (`develop`) to the world; for
the moment, it is meant for presentation/demonstration purposes only,
as we are preparing to demo this software and to have users test it
locally before adding a combination of cryptographic auth and
PostgREST's JWTs (JSON Web Tokens).  Hang tight!


## Linux Quickstart

If you're trying to run Pursuance on a Debian-based Linux distro (such
as Ubuntu) that does _not_ already have Go installed, then just run
this one command:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PursuanceProject/pursuance/develop/install_linux.sh | bash
```

You'll be asked to type in your `sudo` password, then to type two
other commands, but after that, Pursuance should be running on your
system!


## Getting Started

### Install Go

If you're on Linux or macOS _and_ if don't already have
[Go](https://golang.org/dl/) version 1.8 or newer installed
(`$ go version` will tell you), you can install Go by running:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PursuanceProject/install-go/master/install-go.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Then grab and build the `pursuance` source:

```
go get github.com/PursuanceProject/pursuance
```

### macOS Instructions

If you don't already have Postgres 9.5 or newer installed and running,
install it with Homebrew:

```
brew install postgresql
```

Next, you'll need three terminals.

**In the first terminal**, run database migrations, download `postgrest`,
and have `postgrest` connect to Postgres:

```
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/PursuanceProject/pursuance/db
createdb
sudo -u $USER bash init_sql.sh
wget https://github.com/begriffs/postgrest/releases/download/v0.4.3.0/postgrest-v0.4.3.0-osx.tar.xz
tar xvf postgrest-v0.4.3.0-osx.tar.xz
./postgrest postgrest.conf
```

**In the second terminal**, run Pursuance's Go backend:

```
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/PursuanceProject/pursuance
go build
./pursuance
```

**In the third terminal**, install JavaScript dependencies and start
Pursuance's auto-reloading dev server:

```
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/PursuanceProject/pursuance
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

Pursuance should now be running on <http://localhost:8080>!


### Linux Instructions (for Debian, Ubuntu, and related)

If you don't already have Node 7.x installed (`node --version` will tell
you the installed version), install Node by running:

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```


If you don't already have Postgres 9.5 or newer installed and running,
install it by running:

```
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

Next, you'll need three terminals.

**In the first terminal**, run database migrations, download `postgrest`,
and have `postgrest` connect to Postgres:

```
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/PursuanceProject/pursuance/db
sudo -u postgres bash init_sql.sh
wget https://github.com/begriffs/postgrest/releases/download/v0.4.3.0/postgrest-v0.4.3.0-ubuntu.tar.xz
tar xvf postgrest-v0.4.3.0-ubuntu.tar.xz
./postgrest postgrest.conf
```

**In the second terminal**, run Pursuance's Go backend:

```
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/PursuanceProject/pursuance
go build
./pursuance
```

**In the third terminal**, install JavaScript dependencies and start
Pursuance's auto-reloading dev server:

```
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/PursuanceProject/pursuance
npm install
npm run start
```

Pursuance should now be running on <http://localhost:8080>!

### Production Deployment Build

Same as the Linux commands above, with two modifications.

Replace:

```
npm run start
```

with

```
npm run build
```

Replace:

```
go build
./pursuance
```

with

```
go build
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep pursuance
./pursuance -prod -domain YOURDOMAINNAMEGOESHERE.com -http :80 -https :443
```

To send email notifications to users, run
[PursueMail](https://github.com/PursuanceProject/pursuemail)
as instructed in its
[`README`](https://github.com/PursuanceProject/pursuemail#pursuemail).


## Conventions

Please follow these naming and spacing conventions when submitting a pull request:
[React + Redux Conventions](https://unbug.gitbooks.io/react-native-training/content/45_naming_convention.html).


## Code style and format

We use a combination of [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) and [Eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started). Prettier is an opinionated code formatter but does not care about code-quality rules. It only concerns formatting rules. This is why we use Eslint for code-quality rules but not for formatting rules. Read more about the difference between linters and Prettier here: <https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html>. Not ever do we want formatting rules in the `.eslintrc` configuration file. Not implicitly or explicitly. To make sure of that we have a NPM script called verify-eslint-rules (`npm run verify-eslint-rules`) that gives an error if there are Eslint rules somewhere in our `.eslintrc` configuration that conflicts with Prettier's formatting rules.

Before submitting PRs, please fix and format your code using `npm run lint`.


## NPM scripts

Besides from the script [generated by create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#available-scripts) (`npm start`, `npm test`, `npm run build` and `npm run eject`) we have several custom scripts as well:

- `lint` - Runs linting with the `--fix` flag AND formats the code with Prettier (**please run this against your code before submitting PRs**).
- `lint:check` - Just checks the code for lint errors (Eslint only).
- `format` - Automatically fixes the code to fit Prettier's format rules.
- `format:check` - Just checks the code for format errors (Prettier only).
- `ci` - The purpose of this script is to be executed in a CI platform for every pull request. It checks linting, code format and makes sure that there are not any Eslint rules that conflicts with Prettier format rule.
